examples of managerial impotence: ability to work from home flexibility due to illness / illness of children / appointments revoked for entire team because of several who repeatedly abused the privilege, time card fraud, inconsistent standards for productivity and professionalism between employees, not communicating the same information to all team members (before the ability to work from was revoked, everyone got to work from home july 3rd, except for one who specifically asked if that would be the case before leaving on friday june 30th and was told no. after that person left for the day, senior management sent out notice that everyone could in fact work from home on july 3rd. this wasn’t communicated to the employee who had asked before leaving for the day on friday, and showed up on july 3rd to find themselves the only individual within that job function at the office. there was never an apology from management), company outing not communicated to entire team.

when management approached regarding inconsistent standards/expectations between employees, you have placed a target on your back and will be managed out the door no matter how productive or efficient you are.

Everyone works really hard and as a team and does a wonderful job, considering the cons. Great summer and Christmas parties.","first off there are minimum resources, you can't get money pumped into the brand without going through the owner, who believes the brand is dying and has no strategy or vision to keep it alive, instead he makes the management's lives hell. consequently the management has a hard time in being effective. 

there is no overall vision for the company other than it has a 'digital focus' (with zero digital editorial or digital marketing team left), yet the owner isn't willing to invest in digital because he doesn't understand how it works and refuses to listen to employees or trust their advice. there is no strategy for growth. employees feel they are merely treading water and going through the day-to-day. very demoralising.

although the company is in profit this is subsidised by constant mass redundancies (at least once a year). the editorial team now consists of two people, design one, zero marketing. all these redundancies leave a bitter air for the remaining employees who have not only lost their friends suddenly (only given 30 minutes to leave the office) but their workload drastically increases and the brand sinks further. 

be especially warned if you're entering this company in a creative capacity, as it's difficult to see and roi on your role, your job is under constant threat. even if you feel indispensable. 

there are no benefits to speak of. long hours. underpaid (considering lack of benefits). minimum amount of holidays with no chance of it increasing. and you have to use those holidays over the christmas period.",N/A,-1,,-1,1,2,1,,3,1,1,C2,Local registry filing,12,Unqualified,Local GAAP,,units,GBP,1,10897449,0,10897449,0,5076789,8856,0,5067933,3549831,15112714,0,15112714,0,,,,861523,0,0,861523,15974238,8856,4215266,,12542060,,,12128377,413683,,,0,413683,,,,,,413683,,,7789133,585735,,,999418,,999418,3,,3,3,,3,3,,8,3,8,,,1,,,0,0,,,6,6,,95,,0,2,47,62,29,56,0,59,No,No,,,Keech Hospice Care,Bramingham Lane,,,,LU3 3NT,Luton,United Kingdom,GB,,,Bedfordshire,England|Southern|Luton (LU)|Luton,Country|Region|Postal area|Town,,,Pasque Charity,,,Non profit organisations,Charitable organization,No,,,Corporate,Unlisted,,Unlisted,,2016,11,682,0,1,2,19,1339,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,28,29,matched (3),0,,,1,,1

GB03878561,251,3/5/2019,Innovative Technical Company in Advanced Materials,"Advanced Composites is a relatively small company that works in aerospace, defense, and other commercial and industrial sectors. Advanced Composites manufactures high tech, high performance structures out of advanced materials like carbon fiber, fiberglass, and other cutting edge materials. The products that I have been involved in the design and development of include items that make planes fly, make our country safer, or allow others to experience the great outdoors (like with our whitewater rafting oars).

Engineering at ACI is dynamic- for the right person it's great. Unlike many larger aerospace companies, an engineer at ACI gets to be closely involved in all stages of engineering- design and development, prototyping, process engineering, etc. For hands on engineers that means getting to run the CNC machining centers to generate tooling, performing a large scale test, or work side by side with production to develop a process. It's not all sitting behind a computer or all day at a machine either.

Over the years I have seen great opportunity for people to move up in the company. I know that upper management includes people that started in positions such as maintenance or purchasing and worked up to Vice President levels. Additionally, I have seen people move from entry level positions up to QA Mananger, Operations Manager, Business Development Manager, Production Supervisor, Purchasing Manager, and many more. As a small company, the owner knows your name and your contributions directly- which is probably why we have had so much advancement from within. 

For a small company the benefits package is good. There is a good 401k, profit sharing, programs like safety bucks and health incentives. Pay is competitive. As a AS9100 quality management system company, there is a dedicated commitment to continuous improvement and quality.",technically challenging work. in a small company your personal contributions are seen- good or bad.,N/A,1,,1,5,5,5,,5,5,5,U1,Local registry filing,12,Unqualified,Local GAAP,,units,GBP,1,59053356,0,0,59053356,0,,,,,59053356,0,59053356,0,,,,0,,,,59053356,,0,,28800765,20773710,8027055,-52580828,60607883,,113205,-113205,60494678,-2202247,62696925,,,,62696925,10353010,,12548255,1121547,113205,2730926,63818472,74277685,61729430,102,103,,106,106,,,28,,,,,,0,535,,,,36,9,,,,100,,,241,115,44,50,235,,235,No,No,,,Meggitt Advanced Composites Limited,Pilot Way Ansty Business Park,,,,CV7 9JU,Coventry,United Kingdom,GB,,,West Midlands,England|West Midlands|Coventry (CV)|Coventry,Country|Region|Postal area|Town,,,Cobham Advanced Composites Limited,20151125,,Private limited companies,Private limited company,No,19991117,.,Corporate,Unlisted,,Unlisted,,2019,3,710,1,1,1,1,1730,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1,0,,50,matched (3),1,,1,1,,1

there are 4-5 people within the ceo's inner circle that are completely self absorbed and have no interest in developing their employees, staying ahead of the innovation curve, or making clutch even a semi-interesting place to work. the culture and morale is some of the worst (especially with the chicago and ambler offices feeling pitted against each other) that you'll ever experience. 

clutch labels itself as a data-driven marketing technology company, but there is truly nothing innovative or groundbreaking being worked on. the organization stays afloat by constantly plugging holes in a sinking ship (the tech breaks all the time), and major clients have been opting out of their contracts at a steady rate for over a year now. 

clutch is a ticking time bomb, and the fuse is dangerously close to running out for good. leadership can't talk their way around real issues, continue to sweep things under the rug, or run the company in shady/secretive ways much longer.

customers would wait for months on products and management had no idea when they would arrive, and i had to deal with customers constantly asking me about stock. it was a lack of oversees production communication.  i took on multiple projects pilled on my desk that overload of work given to me by multiple managers and employees . extremely stressful job i would come home from work crying in fustration. there was a lack of ethnic diversity and prejudice and favoritism, treated like an outsider. considering i was extremely sweet i would get snoody remarks, and i just took them and never talked back. the company is very outdated and unorganized. there were new computer systems they could install to make people jobs more efficient and easier but because the company was so stuck in their ways and tight on their budget they did not care to make changes. i saw people stressing out. website and marketing outdated haven’t transitioned to new technology or apps. there products aren’t competitive they rely to much on low price which will eventually ruin their margins.  they show a lack of care for their employees the pay is very tight.  there is no room to move up in position in the company the same people have been there for 15+ years and aren’t going anywhere. these are all reasons why their company won’t last. i really wasn’t even going to write anything about it but someone has to say something for it to change. i was so depressed working there i don’t recommend anyone to work here if they want sanity.",N/A,-1,,-1,1,1,1,,1,1,1,C2,Local registry filing,12,Unqualified,Local GAAP,,units,GBP,1,20046034,3814763,15773191,458080,14675504,328877,2700805,11645821,1640153,13286646,10832213,2454433,3113556,3113556,0,0,18321336,9955795,3117547,5247995,34721538,-87865,-3645833,,25568654,9786222,15782432,16234783,-452351,-164207,367668,-531875,-984226,13184,-997410,,,,-997410,,,7127894,2791041,367668,,1793631,9302378,2338690,-7,-4,-3,-8,-4,-3,-4,62,9,-2,7,,,2,-1,78,38,44,,,1,1,4,38,62,98,-4,98,28,27,51,0,134,No,No,,,Trentnet Limited,2nd Floor,20-22 Stukeley Street,,,WC2B 5LR,London,United Kingdom,GB,,,London,England|London Inner|London (WC)|London WC2B,Country|Region|Postal area|Town,,,,,,Private limited companies,Private limited company,No,,,Corporate,Unlisted,,Unlisted,,2018,1,696,1,1,1,10,2292,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,,27,matched (3),0,,,1,,1

GB06423401,285,2/8/2021,Terrible Business,Hour lunch break to get out the office.,"company is run like a circus, there are 4 managers between 50 sales staff.

managers hardly ever available or nowhere to be seen they just disappear into random meetings, leaving you on hold to customers for extended times which effects your bonus.

if you do get hold of a manager they are unhelpful and rude and belittling to you.

systems are outdated and always stop working.

underwriters are rude and anal.

stupid working hours they do a shift rota, 1st week is standard 8 to 5, monday to friday, but the 2nd week you work 11-8 monday to friday, then saturday 8-7, sunday 11-4 then you work another monday to friday 8-5 so work for 8 days, you get 2 days off in the week when 11-8 but working on a saturday 8-7 is pathetic the company think you have no social life, only ever one manager in on a saturday too and people drink alcohol at their desks.

staff lack basic knowledge and common sense when leaving notes on customer files or dont give customers the correct information so customers ring back up wasting both parties time.

company make you believe you can earn a lucrative bonus monthly, you only get entered in the pot after being with the business for 4 months, even then its affected by your call & productivity stats.",N/A,-1,-1,-1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,U1,Local registry filing,12,Unqualified,Local GAAP,,units,GBP,1,5365527,4621567,474906,269055,13434990,0,4117366,9317624,2723931,6768773,1153,6767620,2406631,0,2406631,72506,9625114,77347,5109126,4438640,18800517,-991760,3809876,,26712628,,,16999022,9713606,10905,,10905,9724511,2053165,7671346,,,,7671346,,,7959472,671809,,,8343155,,10385415,144,,52,113,,41,36,,39,36,31,,,3,,,55,69,,,1,1,3,36,56,37,34,94,30,28,24,-3,66,No,No,,,Right Choice Insurance Brokers Limited,St. James House,27-43 Eastern Road,,,RM1 3NH,Romford,United Kingdom,GB,,,Essex,England|London Outer|Romford (RM)|Romford,Country|Region|Postal area|Town,,,,,,Private limited companies,Private limited company,Yes,,,Insurance company,Unlisted,,Unlisted,,2021,2,733,1,1,1,35,2416,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,38,28,matched (3),0,,,1,1,

GB07037852,290,7/16/2018,Technician,Hard working techs that I learned a lot from - Comradery was felt with tenured technicians.,"management is a work in progress - culture & leadership was practically non existent despite many attempts to simulate it - high expectations and work life balance can be tolerable but not realistically sustained. the job will always overrule unless you have a family waiting for you at home.

i witnessed high turnover because some techs couldn't handle the constant demands of their role & its autonomous nature. (again - lack leadership)  imho that is the achilles heel for the company.  a lot of wasted resources spent on promoting leaders that weren't cut out for their groomed roles & you could not really rely on. they were just titles and people you didn't want to have a talk with. there were a lot of individual techs that actually  kept operations running smoothly that were misrepresented & undervalued. this is one of those places that some people just showed up to collect a paycheck (skate by) or others that apparently had rose to ranks of management for tenure & dumb luck alone.  so as a tech, you could find yourself putting in 110 percent for little to no reward over your base pay. yelled at if you missed the mark, no interaction otherwise. did this for years while being passed up for proper compensation given my duties. constantly & consistently proved myself & called out my own growth and even then, no guarantees just canned responses. was let go for under performing by the same people i just described after following up about a pre-assured raise from the previous year. the more you talk about compensation, the more demanding, &  critical mgmt becomes of you. 

advice: don't fall short of their expectations,  get burned out, expect a consistent and fair pay schedule and you'll be a valued gcs employee for however long your sanity holds up.",N/A,-1,-1,-1,2,1,1,,1,1,1,U1,Local registry filing,12,Unqualified,Local GAAP,,units,GBP,1,37364669,16461415,20903254,0,304076934,21911596,74748011,207418494,38995055,264646565,20154000,244492565,8267470,0,8267470,564858,68527568,23545483,18967098,26013820,341441603,77692509,235549366,,236592719,115269583,121323136,45067281,76255855,-7534555,22174,-7556729,68700294,6207605,62492689,,,,62492689,,,25371936,6200602,22174,,68693291,100295006,82456458,26,25,20,24,23,18,29,51,35,32,29,,,1,,11,114,29,,,4,4,32,78,,12,237,816,11,87,913,268,1177,No,No,,,Spts Technologies Limited,Spts Ringland Way,,,,NP18 2TA,Newport,United Kingdom,GB,,,Gwent,Wales|Newport (NP)|Newport,Country|Postal area|Town,,,Spp Process Technology Systems Uk Limited,,,Private limited companies,Private limited company,No,,,Corporate,Unlisted,,Unlisted,,2018,7,702,1,1,2,40,2541,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,1,1,1,0,,87,matched (3),1,,1,1,,1

GB09019417,269,5/8/2015,Aggressive and sometimes violent workplace,I got integration experience and free coffee and pop. The learning curve is steep and if you are up for an incredible challenge you can learn quite a bit in a short amount of time. It is only because there is _something_ good that I can even feel comfortable giving one star to Emerald.,"the ceo is the first negative and the primary reason i left. nicole (the ceo) micromanaged and used aggressive and intimidating tactics to try and ""drive success"". little did she know that those tactics were discouraging people from coming to work or even being around her. because of her there is a revolving door of employees at the company - many don't last more than a few months and even fewer last more than a year.

development safety nets were few (no unit tests, no testing policy, etc) and the primary source of development correction i got was from the seniour dev which was consistently without much regard for the human being he was talking to.

there seemed to be a hiring direction of ""get software developers - they can do everything"". though that may be true (they can do support, installation, hardware stuff, etc) they don't _want_ to - we educated ourselves for _software development_, not support - and certainly not client-facing tasks (which are given to developers all the time; especially new ones because they're cheap).

hours were long and grueling as were the tasks and torment from the ceo. she only trusted one individual there (and he wasn't even her husband) and insulted everyone else - openly. even in meetings. she even insulted clients in large webex or phone meetings. no wonder there's no success.

almost regularly the ceo and management (who are her family) got into aggressive verbal disputes. many of those resulted in name-calling, put downs, and entirely unprofessional behaviour. during my time there i experienced two of those arguments become physically violent.

the first time they locked themselves in a room after the verbal portion got really bad. then us software devs closed our door (directly across the hall from theirs) because it was still extremely loud. moments later someone stormed out of the room was quickly followed by a flying coffee cup (with coffee and cream inside) which smashed into our (thankfully reinforced) glass door.

the second time the ceo and her brother were arguing at length with their door open. after quite some time the ceo stormed out and the other manager threw the door shut with all his might which broke the door frame and sprayed glass shards all over the hallway and into the dev's office space.

i was exhausted at the end of every day just from the environment. with my increase in wages from the previous job i spent the difference almost entirely on stress relief through alcohol.

never before have i been so intensely stressed for such a prolonged period of time that i developed wrinkles on the inside of lips. i never know that was possible.",N/A,-1,-1,-1,1,1,1,,2,1,3,C2,Local registry filing,12,Unqualified,Local GAAP,,units,GBP,1,27588187,27094520,493667,0,16799863,0,5498031,11301832,7250959,12636951,40847,12596104,15437901,0,15437901,2023686,16313198,10881690,1444823,3986685,44388050,4053208,486665,,28556849,10853680,17703169,22814902,-5111733,199568,4195589,-3996022,-9107755,291766,-9399520,,,,-9399520,21811229,,13178468,11653118,4195589,,2253597,19919421,6541385,-72,-18,-21,-74,-19,-21,-32,62,23,-18,8,,,1,-1,,69,18,76,,1,1,1,28,40,208,-34,106,46,49,47,15,165,No,No,,,Emerald Topco Limited,Mandeville House,62 The Broadway,,,HP7 0HJ,Amersham,United Kingdom,GB,,,Buckinghamshire,England|Southern|Hemel Hempstead (HP)|Amersham,Country|Region|Postal area|Town,,,De Facto 2110 Limited,,,Private limited companies,Private limited company,No,,,Corporate,Unlisted,,Unlisted,,2015,5,664,0,1,1,19,2992,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,1,1,,49,matched (3),1,1,,1,1,
GB09019417,269,8/24/2015,Succeeding in a challenging environment,"Emerald Associates is a challenging environment – and this is good and bad. It is true that some people don’t succeed here, but if you are a driven person who likes to challenge yourself and to learn new things, this is the place for you.  This is a results oriented company. You will learn new things. You will better yourself.
As for my own experience – I started in 2009 and started working in a project that had as a client a utility company in Toronto – I got to travel 2 or 3 times there to gather requirements and to train their IT staff, just a few months after landing in the company. After this project, I started working in the refactoring of our dashboarding product, where I learned Flex. I didn’t know Oracle when I started working for Emerald Associates, and now I am pretty proficient at it. Emerald Associates has a small library with good books for new software developers. Effective Java is a required read. It is important for the company that the developers better themselves. I had only used two or three source repository management systems before working here, and I never used a distributed one, and now I don’t want anything else. I introduced new libraries for web development and I helped shape some of the company products and software development in general. I have travelled to the United States a few times to work with clients there and to attend conferences.
And as far as coding is concerned, what I do today is very different than what I did one, two or five years ago. Evolving is a constant condition. There is always a better way to write your code or to make it more readable. There are new Linux tools and tricks I didn’t know about and that I put upon myself to learn just because I felt I needed it. There is a new programming language that I decided to learn after a colleague learnt it himself, and I figured it would be useful for some of the things I do at the company.
Ever since I started working from home, I have been supporting clients worldwide, and continuing the development of the company products.

They give adequate breaks for the amount of hours work.,"massive turnover.  mostly due to many finding a higher paying job. half of the staff are contract workers, and i constantly see new faces each month.  consequently, employees constantly need training leading to an ambiguity of job responsibility. management does a poor job staying on top of it. lack of accountability and follow through by management is a big concern. christmas is the only day off. exceedingly long hours during the holidays of thanksgiving and christmas. 14-15 hr days is not uncommon during this time. cold working environment.",N/A,-1,,,2,2,2,,1,1,4,C2,Local registry filing,12,Unqualified,Local GAAP,,units,GBP,1,55077,0,55077,0,3256977,616016,1493144,1147817,822008,1014630,0,1014630,924,0,924,924,2296500,6155,1069261,1221085,3312054,1039899,960477,,19334711,14451095,4883617,2264579,2619037,,209797,-209797,2409241,5384,2403856,,,,2403856,,,6216439,17204,209797,,2421060,8852680,2636241,237,258,73,237,257,73,12,25,14,14,13,,,19,12,31,28,20,,,1,1,,31,44,1,9,75,32,24,4,4,13,No,No,,,Littleport Mushroom Farms Llp,Hainey Farm Barway Road,Ely,England And Wales,,CB7 5TZ,Ely,United Kingdom,GB,,,Cambridgeshire,England|Eastern|Cambridge (CB)|Ely,Country|Region|Postal area|Town,,,Lmf 2012 Llp,,,Partnerships,Limited liability partnership - LLP,No,,,Corporate,Unlisted,,Unlisted,,2018,10,705,1,1,2,8,3331,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,0,25,24,matched (3),0,,,1,,1
